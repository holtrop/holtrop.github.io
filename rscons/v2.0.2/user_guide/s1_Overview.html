<p>Rscons is an open-source build system for developers.
It supports the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>multi-threaded job execution</li>
<li>auto-configuration</li>
<li>built-in builders for several common operations</li>
<li>out-of-the-box support for C, C++, and D languages</li>
<li>extensibility for other languages or custom builders</li>
<li>compatible with Windows, Linux, OS X, and FreeBSD</li>
<li>colorized output with build progress</li>
<li>build hooks</li>
</ul>

<p>At its core, Rscons is mainly an engine to:</p>

<ul>
<li>determine the proper order to perform build operations,</li>
<li>determine whether each build target is up to date or in need of rebuild, and</li>
<li>schedule those build operations across multiple threads as efficiently as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Along the way, Rscons provides a concise syntax for specifying common types of
build operations, but also provides an extensible framework for performing
custom build operations as well.</p>

<p>Rscons is written in Ruby, and is inspired by <a href="https://scons.org/">SCons</a> and <a href="https://waf.io/">waf</a>.</p>
<a name="s1_1_Design_Principles" /><h2>1.1 Design Principles</h2>
<a name="s1_1_1_Build_Correctness" /><h3>1.1.1 Build Correctness</h3>

<p>The number one design principle in Rscons is build correctness.
This means that a build operation will be performed when Rscons cannot
determine that a build target is already up-to-date.
A build target will be built whenever:</p>

<ul>
<li>the target file has been removed or changed since it was last built</li>
<li>the command to build the target file is different from the previous command
used to build it</li>
<li>any of the target file&#39;s dependency files have changed since the last time
the target was built</li>
</ul>

<p>Importantly, Rscons uses the content of a source (dependency) file to determine
whether a rebuild is necessary, not simply the timestamp of the file.
This is because relying solely on the timestamp of the file can lead to an
incorrect decision being made to not rebuild when a rebuild is necessary.</p>
<a name="s1_1_2_Build_Flexibility" /><h3>1.1.2 Build Flexibility</h3>

<p>Rscons supports multiple configurations of compilation flags or build options
across multiple environments to build output files in different ways according
to the user&#39;s desire.
For example, the same source files can be built into a release executable, but
also compiled with different compilation flags or build options into a test
executable.
Rscons also supports build hooks, which allow the user to further fine-tune the
build system&#39;s operation.
A build hook, for example, can be used to set a build option for only source
files coming from a particular source directory.</p>
<a name="s1_1_3_Build_Efficiency" /><h3>1.1.3 Build Efficiency</h3>

<p>Rscons will automatically determine the number of threads to use based on the
host CPU configuration, and will schedule jobs as efficiently as possible
across the available threads in order to complete the build operation in as
little time as possible.
As development occurs and build operations are executed, Rscons makes use of a
cache file in order to avoid rebuilding a target when it is already up to date.</p>
<a name="s1_1_4_Build_Directory" /><h3>1.1.4 Build Directory</h3>

<p>Rscons was designed to store temporary build artifacts (for example, object
files, dependency files, etc...) in a <code>build</code> directory.
This keeps files generated by the build cleanly separated from user-controlled
source files.</p>
<a name="s1_2_Getting_Started" /><h2>1.2 Getting Started</h2>

<p>To use Rscons on your project, you must:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install the <code>rscons</code> script in your project (See <a href="s2_Installation.html#s2_Installation">Installation</a>).</li>
<li>Write the <code>Rsconscript</code> build script for your project (See <a href="s4_The_Build_Script.html#s4_The_Build_Script">The Build Script</a>).</li>
<li>Use the <code>rscons</code> command in your project (See <a href="s3_Command_Line_Operation.html#s3_Command_Line_Operation">Command-Line Operation</a>).</li>
</ol>
